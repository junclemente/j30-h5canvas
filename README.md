# Project: Type Ahead

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* `Array.prototype.some` checks if at least one element in array meets the criteria
* `Array.prototype.all` checks if all items in array meets the criteria
* `Array.prototype.find` returns the element that matches the specified criteria
* `Array.prototype.findIndex` return the index of the element that matches the specified criteria. This can then be used to delete the item from the array.
* `...` spread syntax notation function in ES6. Allows an iterable to be expanded in place
* `Array.prototype.splice` changes the contents of an array by removing/replacing existing elements
* `Array.prototype.slice` returns a copy of a portion of an array into a new array object. Does not modify the original array.
